In early 2020 my high school was putting on a production of Romeo & Juliet. Most of the stage equipment was provided by the school district, however, the stairs they had did not match the height of the stage. My close friend and I volunteered as we both had a few summers of construction experience. To figure out the stringer layout, I used CAD which made the whole process easy. One unforeseen challenge was stopping the stairs from bowing and twisting as they weren't rigidly attached to the ground. The solution was as simple as adding on more bracing. Although it was a simple project, it was quite satisfying seeing them being used on the night of play.
