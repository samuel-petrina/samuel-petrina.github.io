After doing a few woodworking projects with more intricate joinery, I wanted to try to build something larger and more complex. I also wanted to experiment with using Fusion 360 for the design. After changing from SketchUp to a proper parametric CAD package, I'm not sure why anyone would use SketchUp. Having a quality CAD model also helped a ton when working as I could simply reference the model if I needed a dimension that was missing from the drawings. For material, I decided to use red oak. This was a pleasure to work with in comparison to the much softer woods I had used in the past when doing joinery. For a finish, I used water-based polyurethane. Unfortunately, this did not leave the nicest finish and was very challenging to apply. Overall, I am satisfied with the final product except for the polyurethane finish which left something to be desired.
