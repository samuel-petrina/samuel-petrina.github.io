title: "2023 FSAE Season Conclusion"

If all went to plan, next week, the team would be traveling to the FSAE competition in Michigan. Unfortunately, due to engine troubles, we will not be participating. Due to a failed gear, we would have needed to rebuild most of the engine to get the car running. We decided to call it for the season and save the money to help with our transition to EV. Despite our shortcomings, I still believe we had a successful season. We built Queens' first car in over three years and learned a ton in the process. I created this post to show some interesting photos that I couldn't fit into a specific project write-up.
