My name is Samuel Petrina and I am a third-year engineering student at Queen's University. I am currently working towards my BASc in mechanical engineering with a planned focus in robotics and mechatronics. Currently, my major project is the Queen's Formula SAE car for the 2023 season. This year, I am the team lead for the vehicle dynamics sub-team. Our team is responsible for the design and fabrication of the suspension, steering, and brakes systems. This has given me experience managing larger, long-term projects as well as significant design and manufacturing experience. The role has also pushed me to further develop my leadership and communication skills and requires me to constantly be taking initiative and problem-solving. Our team is planning to compete in the Formula SAE Michigan competition in May.

Outside of school and work, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and woodworker. My favorite winter activity is skiing, both in-bounds and touring, primarily in and around Whistler. In the summer, I spend my free time hiking and more recently, climbing. In essence, if I'm outside, I'm having a good time. If the weather is not so friendly, I enjoy working on a variety of woodworking projects.
