My name is Samuel Petrina and I am an engineering student studying at Queen's University. I am currently working towards my BASc in mechanical engineering with a planned focus in robotics and mechatronics. Currently, my major project is contributing to the Queen's Formula SAE team. This year, I was the team lead for the vehicle dynamics sub-team. Our team was responsible for the design and fabrication of the suspension, steering, and brakes systems. This gave me experience managing larger, long-term projects as well as significant design and manufacturing experience. The role has also pushed me to further develop my leadership and communication skills and requires me to constantly be taking initiative and problem-solving. When I return to school from my internship term, I plan on assuming the role of technical director for the team.

Outside of school and work, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and woodworker. My favourite winter activity is skiing, both in-bounds and touring, primarily in and around Whistler. In the summer, I spend my free time hiking and more recently, climbing. In essence, if I'm outside, I'm having a good time. If the weather is not so friendly, I enjoy working on a variety of woodworking projects.
