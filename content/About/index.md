title: "About me"
---

My name is Samuel Petrina and I am a mechanical engineering student graduating from Queen's University in April 2025. Through 18 months of internship work as well as design-team experience, I have equipped myself with excellent hands-on and technical skills. In these roles, I have demonstrated my ability to work effectively both independently and as part of a larger multidisciplinary team. Additionally, I have developed a wide range of technical skills. I am currently seeking a mechanical engineering design role in the automotive industry.

Currently, my major project is contributing to the Queen's Formula SAE team (FSAE). This year, I am taking on the roles of mechanical team lead as well as suspension lead. This year has been particularly fun because of the many new projects related to our team's transition to an electric drivetrain. Since our team has only previously built IC cars, there are many inter-subteam decisions that I get to help coordinate. Managing the suspension team for a second year also provides a unique opportunity to truly optimize both the design and manufacturing processes.

Outside of engineering, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and woodworker. In the winter I am a keen skier; both in-bounds and touring; primarily in and around Whistler. In the summer, I spend my free time hiking and climbing around Squamish. In essence, if I'm outside, I'm having a good time. If the weather is not so friendly, I enjoy working on a variety of woodworking projects.
