        <p>At my current internship, we have access to Bambu X1 3D printers. I decided doing some practical prints would be a fun way to test them out. I also decided it was a good chance to test out OnShape which I haven&rsquo;t previously used.</p>
<p>My first project was a holder for my work keyfob. Ever since my family started using keyless entry at home, I have not been carrying keys daily. This meant I needed a way to keep my keyfob in my wallet. I designed a small adapter part that holds the fob and allows it to slip nicely into a wallet. Because of the lofted shape, the part fits nicely into a card holder despite being much thicker than a typical card.</p>

<p>The second quick 3D print project was a replacement part for a fridge. The specific fridge model uses double doors with an intermediate part that pivots when the door is shut allowing for a seal. Unfortunately, the cam-follower that pivots the sealing part had broken off. I designed a quick replacement part that snapped into place. Problem solved (for now at least).</p>

<p>The third print I did on the X1 Carbon printer was a mount for my bike light. For some strange reason, someone felt compelled to steal the mount for my rear bike light but leave the actual light. I designed a quick bracket intended to be zip-tied in place. Between the seat post and the plastic part, I added some 1mm rubber gasket for added friction.</p>

</figure>

<p>Because of how simple these designs were, I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to experiment with the PDM features that potentially set OnShape apart. Despite that, I was impressed by how straightforward the basic modelling tools were. These parts were also my first experience with the Bambu X1 Carbon. I was quite impressed with how straightforward it was to get successful, quality prints.</p>
