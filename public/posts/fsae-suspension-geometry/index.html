        <p>In January 2022, I stepped in as vehicle dynamics lead. For the previous two years, work was focused on the car that was put on pause due to COVID-19. At the end of 2022, this design was scraped and the Q23 car design was started new. Because suspension kinematic design had not been completed for over two years, I had to redevelop many techniques and workflows. We completed kinematic design in Optimum K with a primary focus on steering layout. In the past, steering had been compromised due to the tight packaging in a 10” wheel. Therefor, the goal to increase steering range to 27° with proper Ackerman geometry was set early on. After the majority of the hardpoint iteration were complete in Optimum K, I transferred the geometry into Solidworks to drive component design.</p>
