<p>From May until August of 2024, I worked on the battery structures team of Tesla. This role exposed me to design for much higher volumes then I had previously seen before. At my previous internship, typical volumes were 10 to 1000 per year. At Tesla, we were looking at parts being produced at volumes of 10,000 or more per week.</p>
<p>Since the majority of body components in a car are stamped, I had the opportunity to learn much more about designing stamped parts. I worked with the DFM team to run simulations to ensure manufacturaability and I computed complex tolerance stack-ups which are required for large assemblies with many loosely controlled tolerances typical of castings and stamped parts.</p>
<p>All my previous CAD experience had been using Solidworks so I really enjoyed being able to learn surface modeling techniques in Catia. I also was able to learn much more about top-down modeling techniques for large, complex assemblies. Potentailly, the most valuable experience from this internship was the opportuity to truly integrate into the design team. By the end of my 4 months, I was running weekly meetings to coordinate part integration between 10 engineers spread across, design, simulation and manufacturing teams. I believe this level of trust is truly unique for an internship and provided great learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Zaber Technologies is a mid-size robotics firm out of Vancouver that focuses on presicion actuators including linear, rotary, and multi-axis stages. I worked at Zaber from September 2023 until April 2024 primarly on production process improvements. The first project I took on had the goal of improving the inspection process for incoming parts such that we could decrease the number of products failing at end-of-line testing. This involved conducting a series of tests using precision metrology equipment including a CMM. I also created a variety of data visualizations in Python.</p>
<p>The second project I took on was increasing the speed of the preload process for the linear bearings in some of our stages. The first change I implimented was a simplication to the manual preload process for some of Zaber&rsquo;s stages. By conducting FEA simulations and then validating these results using laser interferometry I was able to re-risk a new prel-loading procedure which is both faster and less prone to error. The second big improvement I made was designing an automatic preloading tool which ensures the correct force and even preload across the entire bearing.</p>
<p>Along with the production improvements I implimemented, I also revised a hand-full of parts which gave me experience with many key engineering tools.</p>
