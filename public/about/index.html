    <p>My name is Samuel Petrina and I am a mechanical engineering student graduating from Queen&rsquo;s University in April 2025. Through 18 months of internship work as well as design-team experience, I have equipped myself with excellent hands-on and technical skills. In these roles, I have demonstrated my ability to work effectively both independently and as part of a larger multidisciplinary team. Additionally, I have developed a wide range of technical skills. I am currently seeking a mechanical engineering design role.</p>

<p>Currently, my major projects are contributing to the Queen&rsquo;s Formula SAE team (FSAE) as well as my final-year capstone design project. For capstone, we are designing a reversing gearbox to be used in the 2025 Queen&rsquo;s Baja offroad vehicle.</p>
<p>Outside of engineering, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and woodworker. In the winter I am a keen skier; both in-bounds and touring; primarily in and around Whistler. In the summer, I spend my free time hiking and climbing around Squamish. In essence, if I&rsquo;m outside, I&rsquo;m having a good time. If the weather is not so friendly, I enjoy working on a variety of woodworking projects.</p>
