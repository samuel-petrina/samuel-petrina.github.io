      <description>After doing a few woodworking projects with more intricate joinery, I wanted to try to build something larger and more complex. I also wanted to experiment with using Fusion 360 for the design. After changing from SketchUp to a proper parametric CAD package, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why anyone would use SketchUp. Having a quality CAD model also helped a ton when working as I could simply reference the model if I needed a dimension that was missing from the drawings.</description>
