      <description>In January 2022, I stepped in as vehicle dynamics lead. For the previous two years, work was focused on the car that was put on pause due to COVID-19. At the end of 2022, this design was scraped and the Q23 car design was started new. Because suspension kinematic design had not been completed for over two years, I had to redevelop many techniques and workflows. We completed kinematic design in Optimum K with a primary focus on steering layout.</description>
