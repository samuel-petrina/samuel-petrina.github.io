      <description>Wishbones after being tacked on jigging plate, ready to be welded
In previous years, our team has used carbon fiber control arms made by gluing aluminum lugs into the end of carbon tubing. This works quite well for tie-rods and pushrods where the lug is a simple cylindrical part with a tapped hole for rod-end bearings. The lugs for the wishbones however were a complex 4-axis milling job that caused issues for our team.</description>
