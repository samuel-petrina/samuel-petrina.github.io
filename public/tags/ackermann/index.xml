      <description>One particularly challenging subsystem of an FSAE car is the steering system. The primary reason for the difficulty is how close the front wheels are to the steering wheel. In a street car and most open-wheeled vehicles for that matter, the front wheels are well in front of the steering wheel meaning the steering rack and the steering wheel can be connected with a few universal joints. The classic FSAE solution in the past was to place the steering rack in-line with the upper control arm.</description>
